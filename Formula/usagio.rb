    <<~EOS
      usagio install ran automatically as part of this install/upgrade --
      it registers the menu bar app + auto-swap daemon to run now and at
      every login, and (for the app icon in Login Items) points launchd at
      usagio.app/Contents/MacOS/usagio.

      Run `usagio uninstall` to stop the menu bar and remove autostart.
