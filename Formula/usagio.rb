    <<~EOS
      To run the menu-bar app + auto-swap daemon now and at every login:
        usagio install

      Onboard an account: log in with `claude` or `codex` first, then:
        usagio capture

      Formerly published as `claude-usage`; existing installs migrate on
      `brew upgrade`. State auto-migrates from ~/.config/claude-usage/
      to ~/.config/usagio/ on first run.
