  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      To start the menu bar app + auto-swap daemon (now and at every login),
      run once from your shell:

        usagio install

      It registers the menu bar + daemon under your account and (for the app
      icon in Login Items) points launchd at
      usagio.app/Contents/MacOS/usagio. `brew install` no longer does this
      automatically (Homebrew forbids formulae from writing to your home).

      Run `usagio uninstall` to stop the menu bar and remove autostart.
